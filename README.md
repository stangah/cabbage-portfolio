# Cabbage-Portfolio

This is a portfolio website being built for the multi-talented graphic designer, Jiajia Chen.

## Git workflow

Fork it, clone it, branch it, edit it, add it, commit it, push it, pull it.

## Prerequisites

- Node and npm
- grunt-cli (`npm install -g grunt-cli`)
- Azure cli if you want to deploy to azure (`npm install -g azure-cli`)

## Setup and tools

Run this:

`npm install`

Then run this:

`grunt server`

Now you have a local server instance with a watch task and livereload. Develop away!

If, for some reason, you want to deploy this relatively obscure app to your own azure account, do this:

`grunt azure`

But make sure that you've set up your azure environment first and that you have an azure remote to push to.

## Issues
